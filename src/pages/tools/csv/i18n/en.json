During the conversion process, the tool also cleans the CSV file from unnecessary information, such as empty lines (these are lines without visible information) and comments.

    "shortDescription": "Quickly convert a CSV file to a YAML file.",
    "longDescription": "This tool transforms CSV (Comma Separated Values) data into the YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) data. CSV is a simple, tabular format that is used to represent matrix-like data types consisting of rows and columns. YAML, on the other hand, is a more advanced format (actually a superset of JSON), which creates more human-readable data for serialization, and it supports lists, dictionaries, and nested objects. This program supports various input CSV formats – the input data can be comma-separated (default), semicolon-separated, pipe-separated, or use another completely different delimiter. You can specify the exact delimiter your data uses in the options. Similarly, in the options, you can specify the quote character that is used to wrap CSV fields (by default a double-quote symbol). You can also skip lines that start with comments by specifying the comment symbols in the options. This allows you to keep your data clean by skipping unnecessary lines. There are two ways to convert CSV to YAML. The first method converts each CSV row into a YAML list. The second method extracts headers from the first CSV row and creates YAML objects with keys based on these headers. You can also customize the output YAML format by specifying the number of spaces for indenting YAML structures. If you need to perform the reverse conversion, that is, transform YAML into CSV, you can use our Convert YAML to CSV tool. Csv-abulous!"

For example, if the input file has 4 columns and 3 rows, the output file will have 3 columns and 4 rows. During conversion, the program also cleans the data from unnecessary lines and corrects incomplete data. Specifically, the tool automatically deletes all empty records and comments that begin with a specific character, which you can set in the option. Additionally, in cases where the CSV data is corrupted or lost, the utility completes the file with empty fields or custom fields that can be specified in the options. Csv-abulous!"
